# NJL-and-QFT-at-finite-temperature
Reviewing the chiral symmetry breaking at finite density and temperature in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The Lagrangian which I consider at this review has a SU(2)×SU(2) symmetry.

## NLJ Lagrangian
First, we review the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model:

Where G is the coupling constant and phi is spinor. This lagrangian has U(1) symmetry. In this review, I caluculate the phisical mass m*. According to the QFT, the poles of the two-point correlation function correspond to the physical mass:

So, we can find the physical mass by caluculating the self-energy. 

The equation by which we seek the physical mass m* of this lagrangian is called gap equation. If the coupling constant exceeds the threshold, vacuum transition occurs and the symmetry is broken.

## SU(2)×SU(2) symmetry
We extend NJL lagrangian to SU(2)×SU(2) symmetric theory. In this review, we take the number of flabours is 2, and number of coulors is 3:

where psi is quark:

and tau is 2×2 pauri matrix on flavaor space. (u,d) indicates flavor, (R,G,B) indicates color and (0,1,2,3) indicates spinor.
