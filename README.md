# NJL-and-QFT-at-finite-temperature
Reviewing the chiral symmetry breaking at finite density and temperature in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The Lagrangian which I consider at this review has a SU(2)Ã—SU(2) symmetry.

## NLJ Lagrangian
First, we review the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model:

Where G is the coupling constant and phi is spinor. This lagrangian has U(1) symmetry.
